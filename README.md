# Bioinformatics MCP

An open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrating
industry-standard bioinformatics workflows for students,
scientists and researchers.

**Created and maintained by Emilio Calderon**

Genomics Hybrid System (Skills + MCPs)
A powerful bioinformatics framework combining AI Skills (domain expertise) with MCPs (external tool access) for genomics analysis.
🧬 What This Does
This system bridges the gap between AI knowledge and real genomics tools:

Skills: Encode genomics expertise, standard workflows, and best practices
MCPs: Connect to databases (NCBI, Ensembl), analysis tools (BLAST, GATK), and visualization platforms

🚀 Quick Start

Configure MCPs: Set up connections to your preferred genomics databases and tools
Import Skills: Load domain expertise for your specific analysis needs
Run Analysis: Use natural language to execute complex genomics workflows
